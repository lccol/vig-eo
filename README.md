# ViGEO
Code of the paper "ViGEO: an Assessment of Vision GNNs in Earth Observation" to appear in SSTDM23 workshop @ ICDM 2023.

This repository contains the reimplementation of [ViG architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00272) using PyTorch Geometric and PyTorch Lightning.
The experiments were conducted on RESISC45, PatternNet and BigEarthNet datasets using [torchgeo](https://github.com/microsoft/torchgeo) library.

Paper can be found on arxiv [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09962).
